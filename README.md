# Line-and-Shape-Drawing-Application-

# Overview

This is a C# Windows Forms application for drawing lines, circles, ellipses, and performing geometric transformations such as translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and shearing. The application utilizes DDA and Bresenham algorithms for line drawing and implements the midpoint algorithm for circles and ellipses

from scratch without any **built in function **  .

# Features

- Line Drawing: Implements DDA and Bresenham's algorithm.

- Circle Drawing: Uses the midpoint algorithm.

- Ellipse Drawing: Uses the midpoint ellipse algorithm.

- Geometric Transformations: Supports translation, scaling, rotation, reflection, and shearing.

- User Interface: Interactive GUI with input fields and buttons for operations.

# Installation
